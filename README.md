# Financial-Tracker

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a finance app that tracked 
payments, deposits, and generate reports based on transaction

This will be the first of many more projects to come.
Every project I look to grow my knowledge and acquire a new skill.

## Challenges and Solutions

One challenge I had was managing time. 
I regret not managing my time better or reaching out for help
to understand structure and apply more to this project.

## Tools
IntelliJ
Gitbash
Github

## Future Work
In the future I plan to add colors and better layout designs to this application.
